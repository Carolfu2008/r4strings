# Preface {-}


This book aims to provide a panoramic perspective of the wide array of 
string manipulations that you can perform with R. If you are new to R, or 
lack experience working with character data, this book will help you get 
started with the basics of handling strings. Likewise, if you are already
familiar with R, you will find material that shows you how to do more 
advanced string and text processing operations.

Despite the fact that R may not be as rich and diverse as other scripting 
languages when it comes to string manipulation, it can take you very far if 
you know how. Sadly, documentation on how to manipulate strings and text data 
in R is very scarce. This work is my two cents to increase the number of 
available resources about this indispensable topic for any data scientist.

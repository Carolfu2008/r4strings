# Handling Strings in R {-}

This book aims to help you get started with manipulating strings in R. 

The content is divided in five major parts:

1. Getting started with character strings
2. Formatting and printing text and numbers
3. Input and output
4. Basic manipulations
5. Working with Regular Expressions

If you have minimal or none experience with R, the best place to start is 
[Chapter 1: Introduction](#intro). If you are already familiar with the basics
of vectors and character objects, you can quickly skim this chapter, or skip it, 
and then go to the another chapter.

Chapter 2 describes different ways to format text and numbers. These are 
useful tools for when you want to produce output that will either be displayed
on screen, or that ill be exported to a file.

The third major component of the book has to do with reading in information from
text files, as well as exporting output to text to files.

The fourth part of the book deals with _basic_ string manipulations. By "basic"
we mean any type of manipulation and transformation that does not require
the use of regular expressions.

The fifth part comprises working with regular expressions. Here you will learn
about the basic concepts around regular expressions (regex), the intricacies 
when working with regex in R, and becoming familiar with the regex functions 
in the R package __stringr__.

Last but not least, the last chapters of the book present a couple of case 
studies and extended practical examples that cover the main topics covered
in the book.

Despite the fact that R may not be as rich and diverse as other scripting 
languages when it comes to string manipulation, it can take you very far if 
you know how. Hopefully this text will provide you enough material to do more 
advanced string and text processing operations.
